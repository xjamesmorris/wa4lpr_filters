- INTRFIL: a program intended to create bandpass filters using interdigitated round
rod ¼ wavelength long resonators between a parallel ground planes (slab line).

- WGFIL: a program that will design a wide variety of post and aperture coupled
bandpass filters in rectangular waveguide.

See the respective directories for documentation.

These applications may be compiled under Linux with the 'fpc' compliler, e.g.:

`$ fpc INTRFIL_Ver_1-0.pas`

You can find more information on waveguide filters and an example of using WGFIL in Paul Wade (W1GHZ)'s QEX articles:
